This series explores how the elements reflect the cycles we all experience: creation, destruction, movement, stillness, and transcendence. \u200b We invite you to experience this powerful celebration of life and connection. Light bites will be served, and drinks will be available for purchase. \u200b \u200b FEATURED ARTIST Liana Grigoryan \u200b Liana Grigoryan is an award-winning fashion and fine art photographer based in Los Angeles.

Centrally located in a stunning 1926 Spanish Colonial building by The Grove minutes away from West Hollywood, Rita House bridges centuries of creative history with modern innovation. Originally built in 1929 as a Prop Design Studio for film and television, the building later became a violin factory producing instruments for schools nationwide. In 1967, it was purchased by award-winning costume designer Rita Riggs, who worked with legends like Alfred Hitchcock and Norman Lear. Rita established her design studio here and pioneered a unique model of creative coworking, cultivating a community of design professionals who shared her commitment to excellence and collaboration. \u200b \u200bToday, architects and founders Tash Rahbar and Scott Strumwasser continue Rita\u2019s legacy. After operating their architectural practice in the space for over three decades, they lovingly restored the nearly 100-year-old building and transformed it into the sanctuary for creative exploration it is today\u2014carrying forward Rita\u2019s spirit of innovation and community. In 2024, Rita House expanded its creative capabilities with a full-service production center, including professional content creation facilities and a podcasting studio developed in partnership with Operation Podcast.",

This series explores how the elements reflect the cycles we all experience: creation, destruction, movement, stillness, and transcendence. \u200b We invite you to experience this powerful celebration of life and connection. Light bites will be served, and drinks will be available for purchase. \u200b \u200b FEATURED ARTIST Liana Grigoryan \u200b Liana Grigoryan is an award-winning fashion and fine art photographer based in Los Angeles. Liana\u2019s photography captures the essence of the ever-changing world of fashion through bright colors and unexpected designs. Her work has been featured in Vogue, ELLE USA, Cosmopolitan, L\u2019Officiel, Institute, Beverly Hills Living, Sch\u00f6n, and more magazines. Check out her portfolio here: https://lianagrigoryan.com/ \u200b \u200bRita House is a dynamic, multi-use space where people of all generations come to work, create, film, and host events including art exhibitions, immersive theatre, panels and screenings. Centrally located in a stunning 1926 Spanish Colonial building by The Grove minutes away from West Hollywood, Rita House bridges centuries of creative history with modern innovation. Originally built in 1929 as a Prop Design Studio for film and television, the building later became a violin factory producing instruments for schools nationwide. In 1967, it was purchased by award-winning costume designer Rita Riggs, who worked with legends like Alfred Hitchcock and Norman Lear. Rita established her design studio here and pioneered a unique model of creative coworking, cultivating a community of design professionals who shared her commitment to excellence and collaboration. \u200b \u200bToday, architects and founders Tash Rahbar and Scott Strumwasser continue Rita\u2019s legacy. After operating their architectural practice in the space for over three decades, they lovingly restored the nearly 100-year-old building and transformed it into the sanctuary for creative exploration it is today\u2014carrying forward Rita\u2019s spirit of innovation and community. In 2024, Rita House expanded its creative capabilities with a full-service production center, including professional content creation facilities and a podcasting studio developed in partnership with Operation Podcast.",
