→ Make sure page is focused (click on page first)

### "City won't scroll to center when I press arrow"
→ This is normal - it scrolls smoothly to center
→ Wait a moment for animation to complete

### "I want to jump to a specific city quickly"
→ Use Ctrl+F to search, or scroll manually
→ (Future: We'll add letter-jump search)
