This series explores how the elements reflect the cycles we all experience: creation, destruction, movement, stillness, and transcendence. \u200b We invite you to experience this powerful celebration of life and connection.

Originally built in 1929 as a Prop Design Studio for film and television, the building later became a violin factory producing instruments for schools nationwide. In 1967, it was purchased by award-winning costume designer Rita Riggs, who worked with legends like Alfred Hitchcock and Norman Lear. Rita established her design studio here and pioneered a unique model of creative coworking, cultivating a community of design professionals who shared her commitment to excellence and collaboration. \u200b \u200bToday, architects and founders Tash Rahbar and Scott Strumwasser continue Rita\u2019s legacy. After operating their architectural practice in the space for over three decades, they lovingly restored the nearly 100-year-old building and transformed it into the sanctuary for creative exploration it is today\u2014carrying forward Rita\u2019s spirit of innovation and community. In 2024, Rita House expanded its creative capabilities with a full-service production center, including professional content creation facilities and a podcasting studio developed in partnership with Operation Podcast.",
